# Contributions

It aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.

**If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).**

**1. Fork this repository**

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

**2. Clone the repository**

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/resume_builder.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

**3. Create a branch**

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there or if it is required):

```
cd resume_builder
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```

**4. Make necessary changes and commit those changes**

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add .
```
Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Describe"
```

replacing `Describe` with what you have added or changed.

**5. Push changes to GitHub**

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

**6. Submit your changes for review**

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

Now submit the pull request.

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the main branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
